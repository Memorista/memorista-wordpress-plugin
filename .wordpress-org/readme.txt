== Description ==

#### Memorista is shutting down

We would like to sincerely thank all users of the WordPress plugin **Memorista**. Your trust, feedback, and long-standing support mean a great deal to us, and we are deeply grateful that you chose Memorista to collect and share memories on your websites.

This message is to inform you that Memorista is being sunsetted due to a **lack of time to continue maintaining the project**. Memorista has always been provided **free of charge**, and we never introduced a paid subscription over all these years. Unfortunately, we are no longer able to sustain the required maintenance under these conditions.

The plugin will remain active **until the end of February 2026**. **From March 2026 onwards, all Memorista data will be permanently deleted.**

Please ensure that you **migrate to another guestbook plugin** before this date and **export and securely store your guestbook data** in time to avoid any data loss.

If you are interested in **taking over, pursuing, or maintaining the Memorista project**, please feel free to [get in contact](mailto:info@floriangyger.ch) with us.

Please note that **we accept no liability** for any data loss after the shutdown date.

Once again, **thank you very much** for being part of the Memorista journey. Your support has truly meant everything to us.
